#### Project Summary
In this project I created a pomodoro clock, a simple device that is very useful to manage your tie and improve your productivity. 
This project is from the freeCodeCamp course and I made it using HTML, CSS and jQuery.


#### Made with:
* HTML & CSS
* jQuery


#### Main Features
* In my pomodoro clock you can set the session length in minutes (from 1 to 60 minutes) and the break length in minutes (from 1 to 60 minutes). By default the session length is set to 25 minutes and the break length to 5 minutes.
* There is a start/pause button to start or pause the timer.
* There is a reset button that allows you to stop the timer and reset the session length and the break length to the default values.
* Anytime a session or a break step reaches zero, an alarm sound is emitted.


#### Cross-browser consistency 
The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
