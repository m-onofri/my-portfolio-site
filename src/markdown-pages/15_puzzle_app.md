#### Project Summary
The 15-puzzle game is a classical slide puzzle game that consists in a board game with 15 tiles randomly positioned and a missing tile. The goal of the game is to place the tiles in the right order, making slide moves that involve the empty space in the board game.


#### Made with:
* HTML & CSS
* React.js


#### Main features
* To move tiles you can simply click on the tiles you want to move.
* You can also move two or three tiles at the same time, simply click on the farthest tile from the empty space on the game board.
* There is a counter that counts how many moves you perform to complete the game
* There is a timer that measures how many seconds you need to complete the game


#### Cross-browser consistency 
The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
