description: "This is a project from freeCodeCamp. The goal of this project is to represent the 35 Fastest times up Alpe d'Huez in cycling races with a scatter plot. This graph compares the performances of riders with doping allegations vs riders without doping allegation. To represent these data I used the D3.js library (Data-Driven Document)."
